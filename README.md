# 🌟 K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier from Scratch in Python 🌟


Welcome to the KNN-Scratch-Py project! 🚀 In this repository, you'll find a pure Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. No external libraries, just pure code magic! ✨

🤔 What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

KNN is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

🚀 Key Features
